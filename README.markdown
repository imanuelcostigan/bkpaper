# Review of Burgard & Kjaer's *Funding Costs, Funding Strategies*

In their working paper *Funding costs, funding strategies* (2013, v.12), Burgard & Kjaer (B&K) develop a derivative pricing PDE based on a hedging strategy that eliminates market, counterparty credit risk, but which does not necessarily eliminate all own credit risk. This note expands the derivation of their derivative pricing PDE and corrects an error in it.
